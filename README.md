# RUET CampusConnect
Ruet has many clubs and organizations among our students, teachers,  and office staff. We have various clubs like ASSR, PSR, RUETDC, etc. We also have associations for different zillas. Generally every club and associations have their facebook or messenger group for their internal communication. But facebook is a vast platform that has some demerits. We tend to waste a lot of time on facebook by watching videos and reels. I want to develop a comprehensive web application that serves as a centralized communication and collaboration platform for the diverse array of clubs and organizations within RUET. This web app will provide a dynamic and interactive space for students to engage in discussions, share information, and foster a sense of community within each club and across the university as a whole.
